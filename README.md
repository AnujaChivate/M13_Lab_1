This is M13_Lab_1. Up and running with React.

How to run this project:

1. In one terminal window, run "npm run compile". This will generate employees.js file in public folder
2. Run "npm run watch" in the same terminal window to watch changes to the employees.jsx file. This process runs on port 5500.
3. Run "npm start" command in another terminal window. This runs express app on port 5000.
4. Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 and you should be able to see list of employees.

Note: If you;re executing the project on M1/M2 Macbook, the Airplay receiver uses port 5000 by default. Hence, while running above project you may come across an error saying "Port 5000 already in use". In order to get around this error, open "System Preferences -> Airplay Receiver" and turn it off.
